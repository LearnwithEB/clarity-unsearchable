# Quick Push Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository (30 seconds)

I've opened the GitHub new repository page for you. If it didn't open, visit:
**https://github.com/new**

Fill in:
- **Repository name:** `clarity-unsearchable`
- **Description:** `Clarity and the Unsearchable - AI and the Dream landing page`
- **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
- Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Code

Once you've created the repository, come back here and I'll push everything automatically!

Or run this command:
```bash
cd /Users/ericbrownjr./clarity-unsearchable
git push -u origin main
```

GitHub will prompt you for credentials:
- **Username:** LearnwithEB
- **Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (not your password)

### Need a Personal Access Token?

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Clarity Project"
4. Select scope: `repo` (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password when pushing

**After pushing, your code will be live at:**
https://github.com/LearnwithEB/clarity-unsearchable
